UI North Star (Write This on the Wall)

The player should feel like they are reading the mountain, not a dashboard.

If information cannot plausibly be perceived by a tired mountaineer in bad conditions, it probably shouldn’t be shown explicitly.

Core UI Design Rules

Diegetic first, abstract last

Body signals > environmental cues > minimal overlays

Information degrades with fatigue, weather, and stress

No constant HUD

UI appears only when invoked or triggered by risk

Everything has a cognitive cost

Checking info takes time, attention, or stability

System → UI Mapping
1. Health / Body Condition

System variables

Fatigue

Cold exposure

Hydration

Injury (localized)

UI Expression

Breathing audio changes

Slight camera sway under fatigue

Hand animations become clumsier

Delayed responses to inputs

Frost buildup on screen edges in cold

When explicit info appears

Only when the player stops and “checks themselves”

UI form

Quick, diegetic vignette:

Heavy breathing

Shivering hands

Subtle text like:

“Legs burning. Pace unsustainable.”

No bars. No numbers.

2. Risk Level (Fall / Slip Probability)

System variables

Slope angle

Surface type

Speed

Fatigue

Gear state

UI Expression

Footstep sound texture changes

Micro-slips (visual + audio)

Camera tilt subtly increases

Controller vibration (if applicable) mimics instability

High-risk zones

Peripheral blur increases

Wind audio masks other sounds

Player’s breathing becomes louder than environment

Risk should be felt seconds before it becomes lethal.

3. Time, Light & Weather

System variables

Sun position

Cloud cover

Incoming weather probability

UI Expression

Shadows lengthen in real time

Sun glare affects visibility downhill

Temperature inferred by:

Breath vapor

Ice forming on rock

Clouds visibly thicken on horizon

Explicit time access

Pull out watch (takes time)

Player must stop moving

Time freezes only partially (wind still moves)

This makes checking time a choice.

4. Navigation & Topo Map

This is your most dangerous UI system—easy to ruin immersion here.

Map access

Player physically unfolds map

Wind can obscure it

In strong wind or fatigue, hands shake

Topo presentation

Real contour lines

No “you are here” dot by default

Player estimates location via:

Landmarks

Elevation readout

Memory

Optional assists (difficulty-dependent)

Faint altitude marker

Compass bearing

Known route shading (only after prior descent)

Learning the mountain should feel earned.

5. Route Planning & Replanning

Planning phase UI

Clean, calm topo

Player places mental “pins” (not markers)

Highlights risk zones based on slope & terrain logic

Mid-descent replanning

Map is harder to read

Lighting worse

Cognitive load increased

This reinforces:

You should have planned better earlier.

6. Rope & Gear Management

System variables

Rope length

Anchor quality

Time cost

UI Expression

Physical rope coil in hands

Weight visibly affects posture

Anchors are judged visually, not rated

When placing rope:

Slow animation

Audio focus on knots

No “100% safe” indicator

Uncertainty is the UI.

7. Sliding Mechanic UI

Sliding is high skill, so UI must support anticipation, not forgiveness.

Before slide

Player can “test” slope with foot

Snow displacement visual

Subtle audio pitch change indicating firmness

During slide

Camera lowers

Wind noise ramps

Narrow field of view (tunnel effect)

Exit zones

No UI warning

Only terrain cues (trees, rock color changes)

A good player learns to read exits instinctively.

8. Speed vs Safety Tradeoff

No explicit speed meter.

Speed is inferred by:

Foot cadence

Breathing rhythm

Terrain blur

Pushing speed:

Makes inputs less precise

Increases stumble frequency

This turns “going fast” into a felt risk, not a stat.

9. Failure Feedback (Post-Run UI)

After completion or death:

Topo replay

Your path drawn slowly

Key moments highlighted:

Slide start

Rope placements

Fatigue threshold crossings

Minimal text

“You were moving fast when you needed margin.”

No score screen. No medals.

Minimal Abstract UI (When Absolutely Necessary)

Allowed abstractions:

One small icon when:

Rope mandatory

Severe cold imminent

Appears briefly, fades quickly

Never persistent

If an icon stays on screen, it’s probably wrong.

Accessibility Without Breaking Immersion

Important:

Accessibility options exist, but are opt-in

Examples:

Optional subtle slope shading

Slightly clearer slideable terrain textures

Reduced camera sway

Default experience remains uncompromised.

Sanity Check Question (Use This Constantly)

For every UI element, ask:

“Would a tired climber notice this—or only a gamer?”

If it’s the latter, cut it or bury it.

Final Thought

Your UI shouldn’t say:

“Be careful.”

It should say nothing—and let the mountain say everything.
