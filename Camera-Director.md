Auto-Directing Drone AI
“It doesn’t know what will happen—only when something matters.”
Core Philosophy

A human filmmaker:

Frames risk, not success

Prioritizes context before action

Reacts emotionally, not optimally

Sometimes arrives late

Sometimes pulls away instead of zooming in

Your drone AI must embody these flaws.

AI Architecture Overview

Think in three stacked layers:

Situation Awareness – “Something might happen”

Directorial Intent – “What kind of shot is appropriate?”

Camera Behavior – “How do I move and frame?”

The AI never thinks in coordinates—it thinks in shots.

1. Situation Awareness (What’s Worth Filming)

The AI listens to signals, not events.

Primary Signals (High Weight)

Sudden increase in slope steepness

Player speed change

Sliding state entry

Rope deployment

Fatigue threshold crossed

Loss of footing (micro-slip)

Proximity to cliffs or runouts

Secondary Signals (Mood Setters)

Weather shifts

Light angle changes

Isolation (no landmarks nearby)

Silence (wind drop)

The AI builds anticipation, not reaction.

“This feels like a place something could go wrong.”

2. Directorial Intent (Choosing the Shot)

When a signal crosses a threshold, the AI chooses an intent, not a camera angle.

Shot Intents (Finite Set)
A. Context Shot

“Show how small they are.”

Wide

Static or slow drift

High altitude

Long duration

Triggered by:

New terrain

Major exposure

Pre-slide hesitation

B. Tension Shot

“Stay close, don’t interfere.”

Medium distance

Slight handheld motion

Parallel to movement

Limited duration

Triggered by:

Downclimbing

Traversing

Marginal slopes

C. Commitment Shot

“This is happening now.”

Lower altitude

Forward-biased angle

Accelerating movement

Shorter focal length

Triggered by:

Slide initiation

Rope descent

Sudden speed increase

D. Consequence Shot

“Let it play out.”

Hold framing longer than comfortable

Minimal movement

No zoom-in

May lose subject briefly

Triggered by:

Falls

Uncontrolled slides

Injuries

E. Release Shot

“Breathe.”

Pull-back

Rising altitude

Longer horizon

Calmer motion

Triggered by:

Safe exit

Reaching cabin

End of danger sequence

3. Camera Behavior (How It Moves)

Each shot intent defines rules, not positions.

Movement Rules

Acceleration and deceleration only

No instant direction changes

Wind influence increases with altitude

Obstacle avoidance is late, not perfect

This creates the feeling of a human pilot reacting.

Framing Rules

Player offset from center (rule of thirds)

Sometimes partially occluded

Never perfectly symmetrical

Perfect framing looks fake.

Anticipation vs Reaction (The Big Trick)

The drone AI:

Moves before the slide starts

Drifts toward exit zones

Hovers slightly uphill before danger

But it:

Does not reposition instantly

Sometimes commits to the wrong angle

Must recover like a human would

This makes great shots earned, not guaranteed.

Mistakes Are a Feature

A human filmmaker:

Misses moments

Gets blocked by terrain

Overcorrects

So the AI:

Occasionally frames too wide

Loses subject in whiteout

Arrives late to a fall

Viewers forgive imperfection.
They distrust perfection.

Emotional Rhythm Engine

The AI tracks pacing:

After intense sequence → forced calm shot

After long calm → seeks tension

Avoids rapid shot changes

This creates a filmic arc over a full descent.

Sliding-Specific Direction Logic

Sliding is the money shot.

Before Slide

Context shot

Hold longer than normal

Slight inward drift

During Slide

Lateral tracking preferred

Avoid chasing from behind

Let terrain rush past frame edges

If Slide Escalates

AI hesitates

Then pulls back instead of zooming

Allows scale to tell the story

That restraint is everything.

Sound Design Coupling

Drone audio follows intent:

Loud motors during tension

Nearly silent during wide shots

Sudden audio drop during loss of control

Audio is part of the direction.

Streamer Controls (Subtle Overrides)

Streamers can:

Bias shot intent (context-heavy vs action-heavy)

Lock a shot type temporarily

Increase “human error” slider

They cannot:

Force angles

Teleport the drone

Override safety limits

They are collaborating with the AI, not puppeteering it.

The One Rule That Makes It Work

The drone never steals focus from the mountain.

If the shot shows off the player more than the terrain, it’s wrong.

Why This Will Be Memorable

Viewers feel like they’re watching a documentary

Streamers become storytellers, not cameramen

Every run looks different

Sliding becomes cinematic without being glamorized

You’re not giving players a camera.
You’re giving them a witness.
