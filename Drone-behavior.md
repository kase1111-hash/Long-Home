Drone Behavior During Fatal Mistakes
“The camera does not look away—but it does not exploit.”
Core Principle

The drone never confirms death.
It only records loss of control.

Death is inferred by the absence of recovery.

Phase-Based Drone Response

Fatal mistakes are not a single event. The drone AI treats them as phases, each with different ethical and cinematic rules.

Phase 1: The Moment of Error

(The slip, misjudgment, or overcommitment)

Drone Behavior

The AI hesitates

Micro-delay before reacting

Slight framing error (human shock)

Shot choice

Medium-wide

Player not centered

Terrain dominates frame

Why
A human filmmaker doesn’t instantly know this is fatal.

Phase 2: Loss of Control

(Slide accelerates, arrest fails, rope useless)

Drone Behavior

No zoom-in

No frantic chase

The drone chooses scale over proximity

Shot language

Lateral tracking if possible

Or a static wide shot while the player moves through frame

Camera drifts upward, not downward

This communicates:

“This is bigger than them now.”

Phase 3: The Vanishing

(Player leaves visible terrain or enters terminal runout)

Critical Rule

The drone does not follow blindly into the abyss.

Instead:

It slows

Loses the subject behind terrain

Wind noise overtakes motor sound

Framing

Empty slope

Moving snow

No body visible

This avoids spectacle and preserves dignity.

Phase 4: Aftermath (Silence Is the UI)
Drone Behavior

The drone holds position

No music

No motion for several seconds

Wind continues.
Snow settles.
Nothing happens.

This is one of the most important moments in the entire game.

Phase 5: Acknowledgment Without Confirmation

The drone:

Slowly ascends

Pulls back

Reveals the enormity of the terrain

No text.
No marker.
No body.

The mountain remains.

Special Case: Fatal Slide (The Most Dangerous One)

Sliding deaths are common—and must be handled with care.

Sliding-Specific Rules

During early slide: drone tracks laterally

As speed escalates:

Drone pulls away

Not closer

When slide becomes terminal:

Drone loses subject naturally (terrain break, curvature)

Watching someone disappear is more powerful than watching them impact.

What the Drone NEVER Does

This is non-negotiable.

The drone must not:

Zoom in on impact

Follow into unseen voids

Reframe to show the body clearly

Circle a stopped body

Hover directly overhead

No autopsy shots.
No spectacle.
No triumph of the camera.

Audio as Ethical Control

Audio does more than visuals here.

During Loss

Wind drowns out motor

Player audio cuts abruptly (not fade)

Drone motor stabilizes, almost calm

After Vanish

Only wind

Occasional ice movement

No score, no sting

Silence is respect.

Hard Mode Twist (Quietly Brutal)

In the hardest mode:

The drone sometimes arrives late

The fatal moment is partially off-frame

Viewers see only the aftermath

This reinforces:

The mountain doesn’t wait for witnesses.

Replay Handling of Fatal Runs

Replays should not glamorize.

Rules:

Fatal moments are replayed once, at normal speed

No slow-motion

No camera switching

One continuous take

After that, replay defaults to the path, not the fall.

Psychological Effect (Why This Works)

Players report:

Shame, not anger

Reflection, not rage

Respect for risk, not frustration

Stream audiences go quiet.

That silence is success.

One Sentence That Defines It

The drone records the truth, but it does not sensationalize it.

Closing Thought

Most games treat death as:

A failure state

A spectacle

A reset

Yours treats it as:

An ending that didn’t need commentary

That restraint will make this game unforgettable.
