1. Why a Drone Belongs in This World

Fictionally, the drone is:

A lightweight alpine recon drone

Battery-limited

Wind-limited

Line-of-sight constrained

Vulnerable to turbulence and cold

It is not a minimap replacement.
It is not omniscient.

Philosophically:

The drone shows how small you are, not how safe you are.

That framing keeps it honest.

2. Two Distinct Drone Roles (Never Blend These)
A. Spectator / Streamer Drone (Non-Diegetic)

Purpose: storytelling, audience comprehension, cinematic tension
Effect on gameplay: none

Always available in streamer/spectator mode

Player performance is unchanged

Drone feed is parallel, not shared with player HUD

Think of it as a documentary camera crew.

B. Scout Drone (Diegetic, Easy Mode Only)

Purpose: limited recon at a cost
Effect on gameplay: meaningful trade-offs

Optional

Constrained

Never perfectly reliable

This distinction is critical.

3. Camera Language: How the Drone Sees

This is where you avoid turning it into a cheat.

Drone Camera Rules

Wide lenses only (no sniper zoom)

Slight fisheye distortion at edges

Depth perception exaggerates steepness

Wind buffeting subtly affects framing

Exposure struggles in snow + shadow

The drone should feel unstable, not surgical.

Signature Shots (Streamer Gold)

Long lateral tracking along a face

High pull-back revealing exposure

Static wide while player moves through frame

Slow orbit during rope placement

Sudden pull-up when player slips

The camera reacts to danger—it doesn’t predict it.

4. Control Model (Who’s Flying?)
Spectator Mode

Full free-fly camera

Momentum-based movement

Acceleration curves (no instant stops)

Wind zones push the drone

This keeps it cinematic instead of twitchy.

Scout Drone (Player-Controlled)

Player must stop moving to deploy

Camera control competes with time passing

Drone battery drains faster in wind/cold

Maximum range from player

Signal degradation beyond terrain occlusion

You’re trading time + exposure for information.

5. What the Drone Is Never Allowed to Reveal

This is non-negotiable.

The drone must NOT:

Highlight safe paths

Color-code slope angles

Reveal friction coefficients

Identify slideable vs lethal snow

Predict exits

It shows shape, not truth.

Veterans still need judgment.

6. Information Asymmetry (Subtle but Powerful)

The drone sees things the player can’t—but also misses things the player feels.

Examples:

Drone shows a slope looks smooth → actually icy

Drone can’t hear snow settling

Drone can’t sense firmness

Drone can’t feel fatigue

This preserves sliding fear even with aerial views.

7. UI for Drone Mode (Streamer-First)
On-Screen Elements (Minimal)

Altitude readout (relative, not absolute)

Battery arc

Wind strength indicator (abstract, not numeric)

No minimap.
No compass overlay by default.

The drone UI looks like real footage, not telemetry porn.

8. Streamer Tools (But Invisible In-World)

Streamer mode adds:

Shot presets (chase, orbit, pull-back)

Safe-distance lock (prevents collision with terrain)

Auto-focus on player

Cinematic camera shake tuned for danger

These are off by default for players.

9. Audio Design: The Drone Should Be Heard

Important immersion trick:

The player hears the drone faintly

Wind masks it at times

Sound cuts when signal weakens

For spectators:

Drone audio layered over environmental sound

Occasional static or signal drop

It reinforces fragility.

10. Easy Mode Scout Drone: Cost Structure

Using the scout drone:

Time advances while scouting

Weather may worsen

Cold exposure continues

Fatigue recovers slower

It is a strategic pause, not a free look.

11. Hard Mode Inversion (Cruel, Beautiful Touch)

In hardest modes:

Scout drone is disabled

Spectator drone still exists

But during major falls or slides:

Spectator drone sometimes loses the player

Camera scrambles to reacquire

You watch them vanish into terrain

For viewers, this is devastating.
For players, it reinforces helplessness.

12. One Rule That Makes This Legendary

The drone can never save you—only show how close you came.

That’s the line.

Why This Works

Streamers get breathtaking footage

Viewers understand terrain without spoilers

New players can learn visually

Veterans still rely on instinct

Sliding remains terrifying from above

Watching someone slide from a drone is scarier than being in first person.

That’s rare—and powerful.
