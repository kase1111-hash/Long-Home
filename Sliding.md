Sliding: Design Pillars

Sliding is never fully safe

Even perfect slides carry residual risk

Control is indirect

You influence, you don’t command

The mountain decides the outcome

Player skill shifts probabilities, not certainties

Speed amplifies both success and failure

Sliding trades time for margin

You gain time, you lose forgiveness

Veterans don’t “unlock” sliding.
They learn when it won’t kill them.

Physical Model (Reality-First)
Preconditions for Sliding

Sliding is possible only when:

Slope angle is within a narrow band (e.g. ~25–40° depending on surface)

Surface cohesion supports controlled descent (snow firmness, scree size)

Player posture and speed are compatible

If these aren’t met, sliding either:

Doesn’t initiate

Immediately becomes uncontrolled

No tutorial tells you this.
Your body learns.

Sliding State Is a Spectrum, Not a Mode

Instead of:

Walk → Slide → Fall

Use:

Controlled descent

Marginal control

Accelerating instability

Loss of control

The player is always sliding a little when descending steep terrain—sometimes that’s okay.

Control Model: Influence, Not Authority
Player Inputs Affect:

Weight shift (lean forward/back)

Edge engagement (boots, heels)

Surface interaction (hands, axe if equipped)

Commitment (hesitation makes things worse)

Inputs do not:

Stop momentum instantly

Override slope physics

Guarantee recovery

This keeps it honest.

Sensory & UI Language (Fear Engine)
For New Players (Fear)

Sliding is terrifying because:

Camera drops closer to ground

Wind noise overtakes ambient sound

Peripheral blur increases

Input latency subtly increases at speed

Terrain rushes sideways, not forward

The player feels speed without a speedometer.

For Veterans (Readability)

As skill grows, players learn to read:

Snow texture changes

Micro-bumps that bleed speed

Color and shadow indicating surface firmness

The sound pitch of friction

These cues were always there—the player just didn’t know how to interpret them yet.

Sliding Entry: The Point of Commitment

Sliding should have a moment of no return:

A brief posture shift

A breath intake

A friction release sound

This moment creates tension:

“Am I sure?”

Veterans wait for that feeling before committing.

Exit Zones: Where Slides Are Won or Lost

The most important sliding skill is knowing where to stop.

Exit zones should be:

Visually subtle

Slight slope reductions

Texture changes

Snow accumulation pockets

No UI highlight.

New players overshoot.
Veterans aim for them deliberately.

Failure Taxonomy (Not All Slides Kill You)

Sliding failures should scale:

Minor Overrun

Extra distance

Fatigue spike

Hard Stop

Tumble

Injury chance

Compound Slide

Transition into steeper slope

Terminal Runout

No exit

Death likely

Fear comes from not knowing which you’re in until it’s almost too late.

Skill Curve: Why Veterans Love It
Early Player Experience

Sliding feels chaotic

Surviving a slide feels lucky

Most slides are reactive

Mid-Level Player

Recognizes safe slope bands

Begins planning slides

Still avoids long runs

Veteran Player

Chains slides

Uses terrain to scrub speed

Slides only when exit is guaranteed

Saves hours of game time

Speedruns exist—but they’re terrifying to watch.

Sliding + Other Systems (Where It Gets Deep)
Sliding vs Time

Sliding saves daylight

Sliding increases fatigue and injury risk

Sliding vs Gear

Heavy pack = more momentum

Light pack = less forgiveness

Sliding vs Rescue

Dragging someone? Sliding becomes:

Harder to initiate

Much harder to stop

More dangerous but sometimes necessary

Veterans know when sliding is the least bad option.

Psychological Trick That Makes This Work

Never label sliding as “advanced.”

The game treats it as:

“A thing people do sometimes.”

That ambiguity makes new players curious and veterans reverent.

One Crucial Anti-Gimmick Rule

Sliding must sometimes feel like a mistake even when executed well.

A perfect slide that almost goes wrong reinforces humility.

That’s realism.

Final Framing

Sliding is:

The fastest way down

The easiest way to die

The most honest conversation with the mountain

New players fear it because they don’t understand it.
Veterans respect it because they do.
