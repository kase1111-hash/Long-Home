# Long-Home

Core Thesis (Anchor This Early)

The game is about consequence, not conquest.

You don’t win by reaching the summit.
You win by returning intact, having made good decisions before and after the summit.

That framing alone already differentiates it from 99% of mountain games.

Core Loop (Moment-to-Moment Play)

1. Start State (Pre-Summit Conditions)
You begin at the summit, but the difficulty is locked in beforehand:

Time of day (sun angle, shadows, freeze–thaw cycles)

Weather window (stable, deteriorating, whiteout risk)

Gear loadout (rope length, crampons, layers, emergency bivy)

Physical condition (fatigue, hydration, minor injuries)

Knowledge (route beta, topo familiarity, previous ascent experience)

Important: these aren’t “difficulty sliders.”
They are trade-offs. Every advantage costs weight, time, or stamina.

2. Descent Planning Phase (Low-pressure, High Stakes)
Before moving:

Study the topo map

Choose descent line(s)

Identify:

High-risk zones

Slideable slopes

Mandatory rope sections

Escape options

Time-to-dark thresholds

This phase should feel calm but heavy—like chess before the clock starts.

3. Descent Execution (Real-Time Tension)
You move downhill in continuous time:

Momentum matters

Speed increases risk

Slowing down increases exposure (cold, weather, darkness)

Key verbs:

Walk / Downclimb

Controlled slide

Arrest slide

Rappel

Traverse

Rest (rare, dangerous if misused)

The game is not about button mashing.
It’s about judgment under fatigue.

4. Consequence Resolution
Mistakes don’t always kill you instantly:

Twisted ankle → slower movement

Lost glove → cold penalty later

Rope jam → time loss

Small slide → gear damage

The mountain remembers.

5. Survival Return
The goal is not “finish fast” — it’s:

Finish alive

Finish intact

Finish with margin

Speed becomes a secondary optimization, not the primary win condition.

Difficulty Is a Function of Starting Conditions (This Is Key)

Instead of:

Easy / Normal / Hard

You have:

Environmental difficulty

Preparation difficulty

Knowledge difficulty

Example:

Clear weather + bad gear = medium

Bad weather + good gear = hard

Clear weather + light gear + fatigue = deceptively lethal

This mirrors real mountaineering psychology beautifully.

Terrain & World Design (Your Big Technical Pillar)
1. Real Mountains, Real Topo

Use:

Public-domain USGS topo maps

DEM (digital elevation models)

Real slope angles

Terrain generation rules:

Steepness determines:

Walkable vs downclimb vs slide vs rappel

Aspect affects:

Ice formation

Sun melt

Drainage logic:

Creeks form in realistic gullies

Wet rock near water = slip risk

Cliffs form at contour compression thresholds

You’re not “painting terrain.”
You’re interpreting terrain.

2. Terrain Is Read, Not Marked

No glowing paths.

Players must learn:

How to read contour spacing

What “safe-looking” terrain lies

Why a wide slope might still be dangerous

This gives the game educational gravity without tutorials.

Sliding as a High-Skill Mechanic (Great Idea)

Sliding should be:

Fast

Efficient

Terrifying

Rules:

Only safe within certain slope angles

Speed compounds quickly

Surface matters (snow, scree, ice)

Transition zones are deadly

A perfect slide saves minutes.
A misjudged slide ends the run.

Sliding is where player mastery lives.

Rope Use: Strategic, Not Automatic

Ropes:

Cost time to deploy

Require anchors (terrain-dependent)

Reduce fall risk but increase exposure time

Bad rope decisions:

Rope too early → nightfall later

Rope too late → terminal mistake

Sometimes:

The best move is no rope

Sometimes it’s non-negotiable

This makes ropes feel like real tools, not abilities.

Time Scaling (Very Important You Noted This)

Example:

1 real minute = 10 in-game minutes

Or adjustable per mountain scale

Time affects:

Light

Temperature

Snow condition

Weather roll probability

Descending fast is good—but only if conditions allow it.

What Else You Still Need (Critical Missing Systems)
1. Risk Visibility System

Not a HUD meter.

Instead:

Subtle cues:

Sound changes

Camera shake

Breathing rate

Micro-slips

Players feel risk before seeing it

This avoids gamification while keeping fairness.

2. Knowledge Progression (No XP)

You don’t “level up.”

You learn:

Mountains you’ve descended before feel familiar

You recognize danger patterns faster

Route memory reduces planning time

Knowledge is persistent, not stats.

3. Failure Philosophy

Deaths shouldn’t feel random.
They should feel:

“I knew better.”

Post-run:

Show a replay on the topo

Highlight where decisions compounded

No blame, just clarity

This makes failure addictive instead of frustrating.

4. Emotional Tone

No bombastic music.

Soundscape:

Wind

Crampon scrape

Rope tension

Breathing

Silence

Let players sit with their thoughts. This is a return, not a victory lap.

5. End States (Not Just Win/Lose)

Outcomes:

Clean return

Injured return

Forced bivy

Rescue

Fatality

Some “losses” are still meaningful completions.

Comparable Touchstones (But You’re Still Unique)

Journey (emotional pacing)

Death Stranding (terrain respect)

The Long Dark (environment as antagonist)

Real mountaineering accident reports (seriously—goldmine)

But none of these focus on descent psychology the way you are.

Big Picture: What You’re Really Building

This is a game about:

Hubris vs humility

Preparation vs improvisation

The quiet cost of success

Most games ask:

“Can you reach the top?”

Yours asks:

“Were you ready to come back?”

That’s rare—and powerful.
